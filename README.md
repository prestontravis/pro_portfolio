# Professional Portfolio challenge!  

## Description
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work.  
WHEN I load their portfolio.  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation.  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work.  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application.  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications.  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
